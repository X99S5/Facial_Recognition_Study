# Facial_Recognition_Project

The code can be run from main.py.

The process behind the code is better seen in the A-B folders with jupyter notebook file.

The problem addressed by this project, relates to facial recognition, in that, an artificial
intelligence model is fitted to certain datasets, in order to predict some underlying physical attribute.
The 2 datasets in question are a cartoon set, which contains images of cartoon faces, and a celebrity
dataset which contains facial images of celebrities. There are 4 main tasks in this project, where the first
task A1, is about detecting gender in the celebrity dataset. The second task, A2, also pertains to the
celebrity dataset but involves detecting whether someone is smiling or not. Task B1/B2 relates to
detecting face shape/eye color respectively and is applied to the cartoon dataset.

In this project simple machine learning algorithms can provide good prediction accuracies (above 
80% to even close to 90%) depending on the dataset. However, to maximize performance and 
reach above 90% and even close to 100%, neural networks are necessary. We use a total of 4 Machine learning 
methods  (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, K-Nearest-Neighbors) 
alongside other related methods and testing cases such as with PCA etc.
